This is an experiment similar to Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon

what I want to compute is the minimum steps needed from "name1" to "name2"

  key     python ./starDegree.py "name1" "name2"
  or      python ./starDegree.py          
  then watch steps needed from "Jaden Smith" to "Angelina Jolie" (surprise!)

need lxml for Python

Very slow......
